# E-COMMERCE CHATBOT USING LSTM

How to Use the Chatbot:

You can use the chatbot in two ways. First, open a file called ecommerce-chatbot.ipynb in Jupyter notebook. There, we made the chatbot understand and answer questions using a dataset from Kaggle. We also made sure it works well.

Second, you can use the chatbot on a website. This chatbot was made using a framework called Django. To use it, go to the django-implemented-chatbot folder in the repository and follow the instructions to start the web-based chatbot. After running the development server goto url/chat to access the chatbot.
